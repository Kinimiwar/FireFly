To compile FireFly you will need Visual Studio. If you use the Express Edition
you will also need the Windows SDK.

The source comes with precompiled static libraries for AngelScript and
Scintilla built with VS 2008. If you're using a different version
you will probably have to recompile these.

Compiling AngelScript is pretty straight forward, it comes with project files
for pretty much any major IDE (and cmake if necessary).

Scintilla is a little bit trickier:
FireFly only needs the C++ lexer, so you should delete all files from the lexers
folder except LexCPP.cxx. Then run src/LexGen.py which removes all references to the
now deleted lexers.
Create a new project and add everything that's in lexers, lexlib, src and win32.
Add STATIC_BUILD and SCI_LEXER to the preprocessor directives to get a static library
and lexer support.
Add src, lexlib and and include to the additional include directories.
This setup should compile to a single static library that contains both Scintilla and
the C++ lexer.
